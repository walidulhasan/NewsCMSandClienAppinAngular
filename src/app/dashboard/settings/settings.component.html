            <p class="summary-paragraph">Newspaper readers more readily trust news than advertising content. Therefore,
              journalists and media scholars consider it important that audiences can distinguish between news stories
              and advertisements. The authors collected survey responses from 321 daily newspapers on their standards
              for acceptable advertising for publication. The responses were analyzed to discover if advertising
              acceptance policies and practices reflect publications' willingness to blur the lines between news and
              advertising sections. The data indicate that most newspapers are careful about letting advertisers pretend
              their messages are really news stories. In general, newspapers 'journalistic priorities for honesty
              influence their advertising policies. A few newspapers may use the editorial content to help sell
              advertising space and otherwise blur the lines between news and advertising content, but it is not a
              common and widespread problem.</p>
